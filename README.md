Android Application created for the R&D course of the Computing Science Bachelor from the Radboud University Nijmegen.
The application is a standard Java Android application, in which we created a way to keep shared checklists.
Our idea behind the application is that it can be used to share packing lists for vacations, festivals or any other event for which multiple people need to correspond about their luggage.
Besides this it can of course also be used for all other kinds of means for which a shared checklist can be used!
